## Tools/Utilities
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (Includes netcat by default)

  - ADTools (https://github.com/LordNem/ADTools.git)

## Other
- VirtualBox Guest Additions, with clipboard enabled and a shared folder to c:\pentest on the host
- Windows Defender has an exclusion for c:\pentest
- Explorer file extensions and hidden files are enabled

## Building
Download and extract packer.exe from https://www.packer.io/downloads.html to the root of the cloned repo.
By default it assumes that the Windows 10 ISO is an evaluation copy placed in the repo root folder and named windows_10_evaluation_x64.iso. To change this, edit the "iso_url" variable at the end of the "win10.json" file. You might also need to update the "iso_checksum" variable too.
Run the build.bat, and wait. Unfortunately you will have to interact with the build to confirm the region and language - I can't figure a way to get the unattend to handle this.
When it's completed, it should shut down and you should have an .ovf file.
