## Building
Download and extract packer.exe from https://www.packer.io/downloads.html to the root of the cloned repo.

By default it assumes that the Windows 10 ISO is an evaluation copy placed in the repo root folder and named windows_10_evaluation_x64.iso. To change this, edit the "iso_url" variable at the end of the "win10.json" file. You might also need to update the "iso_checksum" variable too.

Run the build.bat, and wait. You _shouldn't_ need to interact. It will seem to be doing nothing after it finishes one batch of installs and before WinRM kicks in to finish things off; keep an eye on the logs from the bat file. When it's completed, it should shut down and you should have an .ovf file.
